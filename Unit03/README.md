# Seeker
Experience the thrill of the chase! <i>Seeker</i> might seem easy but 
even the best get lost from time to time. The rules are simple. The 
seeker guesses the hider's location and the hider provides a hint - 
that's confidence! Guessing continues until the hider is found.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have dotnet 6.0 or newer installed on your machine. Open 
a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program 
by running the following commands.
```
dotnet build
dotnet run 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. 
Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select "Run and Debug" on 
the Activity Bar. Next, select the project you'd like to run from the 
drop down list at the top of the Side Bar. Lastly, click the green 
arrow or "start debugging" button.

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- Game                (source code folder)
+-- Program.cs          (program entry point)    
+-- README.md           (general info)
+-- Unit03.csproj       (dotnet project file)
```

## Encapsulation Question
* What is encapsulation and why is it important? 
Encapsulation is the process of using dissemination of information. 
Basically, hiding information through using access modifiers is pos-
sible by using conventional means or keywords, thus safeguarding code.
What the user does not need to see nor interact with is covered up or 
protected so that code procedures do not fail. Additionally, it
modifies who has access to information or data, thus protecting
data and information from user corruption or improper modification.  
Another benefit of this encapsulation method is the simplification of 
assignments, user interactions, and related input to the code.
I feel like the combining of encapsulation with abstraction gives
programmers the opportunity to expand upon the abstraction of ideas
for the projects contained within the written code. The better
structured the encapsulation, the better the chances of having an
improved abstraction method to create games, files, and projects that
are more user-friendly and benenficial it is for users, programmers,
project managers, companies, and all!
